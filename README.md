# Flatiron School Module 1 Final Project
Team Members: Allison Drexler and Brendan Bullivant 

## Introduction
For this data science project, we collected and analyzed data regarding the film industry. We decided to look at the success of films based on their pass/fail rate of the Bechdel Test. To get the data for collection and analysis, we used API calls/Request libraries and BeautifulSoup. For analysis and visualizations, we used Pands and Matplotlib. In total, we looked at data of over 8000 movies, spanning from the late 19th century to the present.

## Project Goals
Our goal is to answer the following questions through data collection and analysis:
1. Is there a correlation between the total amount of money that films passing the Bechdel Test make every year compared to non-passing films?
2. Is there a change in the percentage of films that pass the test over time?
3. Is there an increase in films passing the Bechdel Test over time?
4. Is it more profitable for production companies to make their films pass the Bechdel Test?

### Files in this Respository:
- module1mediaproject-API.ipynb - Jupyter notebook demonstrating API calls from BechdelTest.com along with associated visualizations and dataframes
- student.ipynb - Jupyter notebook demonstrating webscraping from BoxOfficeMojo along with associated visualizations and dataframes

### Data Collection
- BeauitfulSoup
- Request
- Json
- Pandas

### Data Cleaning & Visualization
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

### Sources:
- BechdelTest.com
- Box Office Mojo (by IMDB)

## Recommendation
Based on our analysis, we recommend that production companies focus on making more films that pass the Bechtel Test!
